    "comp" => "iPhone 6s is in comparison to iPhone 6 and iPhone SE better in almost everything. I tis important to mention, that Iphone 6 is a year older, so it’s understandable, that the newer model surpasses the old one. 6s has better both cameras. SE, which came out a year later, even has worse front camera resolution. When it comes to the sensors, nothing really changed, only the more compact SE lost a barometer. The capacity of the battery is worse though. Compared to 6, the capacity is smaller, which is noticeable. With newer model came out a newer chip, which cannot be said about the SE. Another disadvantage of iPhone 6s compared to the other two is its weight. It makes up for it with its RAM, which is bigger than in the iPhone 6. iPhone 6s is a good compromise between price and performance."
